0.1.1 (2021-05-28):
    - Backport of contributions from Andreas Abel to update for modern
      GHC.  Removed tabs, reformatted with hindent, updated Makefile
      for modern cabal, added github workflow.  Delinted.
0.1.0 (2015-04-02):
    - Restructured API so default is to keep partial analysis results;
      old way was too error-prone.
0.0.1 (2015-03-14):
    - Initial version.
